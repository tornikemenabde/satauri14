    visual designer, front-end
    developer, and accessibility

    <h3>about</h3><p>Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly.
      Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design.
      Designers are toolmakers.
      Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator.
      Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution.
      Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.</p>
